"""Production-grade configuration validation at app startup.

Different from `verify_apns_configured` and `verify_siwa_configured`
(which are warn-and-continue because Apple .p8 files have multi-day
recovery profiles), this module fail-closes on missing or sentinel
secrets in production environments. The recovery profile for these
secrets is seconds (set the env var, redeploy), so coupling deploy
success to "secret is set" is correct: the app should refuse to serve
rather than serve insecurely.

Secrets validated:
  - `jwt_secret_key`: HS256 key for our own access tokens. Empty in
    production = trivially-forgeable JWTs.
  - `encryption_key`: Fernet key for OAuth tokens + PHI columns. Empty
    in production = the EncryptedString columns silently fail at write
    time and existing data becomes unreadable on rotate.
  - `anthropic_api_key`: chat won't work without it. Less critical
    (graceful 500 from Anthropic vs broken auth), so log + continue.
  - `app_secret_key`: literal "change-me" sentinel ships if unset.
    Currently unused but log + continue if seen.
  - `apns_environment`: must be "sandbox" or "production"; a typo
    silently sends pushes to the wrong APNs cluster. Log + continue.

In development, all checks log info but never raise — local dev with
a SQLite DB and no real secrets is the expected state.

This complements the PEM verifiers; lifespan calls this first so a
missing JWT secret fails the deploy before the .p8 verifier even runs.
