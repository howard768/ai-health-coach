"""Symmetric encryption for OAuth tokens and other secrets at rest.

Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) from the `cryptography` library: authenticated
encryption that prevents both tampering and snooping. Wrapped in ``MultiFernet``
so keys can be rotated without a single big migration window.

Threat model:
- If someone steals the SQLite file or a Postgres backup, OAuth tokens and
  other encrypted columns are ciphertext, not usable credentials.
- Decryption keys live in Railway env vars, never in the DB or codebase.
- A single compromise (env leak plus DB leak) defeats this. Defense in depth,
  not perfect security.

Config:
    ENCRYPTION_KEY      Comma-separated list of Fernet keys. The FIRST key is
                        the active key used for every new write. Remaining
                        keys are tried on decrypt so ciphertext written with a
                        retired key still reads while we drain the DB.
                        A single-key value (no commas) behaves identically to
                        a single-key Fernet config.
                        Generate one with:
                            python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

Missing key behavior: when ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` is unset or unparseable, the
module logs a warning once and falls through to plaintext storage. This is
the legacy behavior, preserved here. A follow-up change will tighten this to
fail closed in production.

Legacy plaintext rows: a row whose ciphertext cannot be decoded by any
configured key is assumed to be a pre-encryption row and returned unchanged.
That read is logged at warning level so "legacy row" can be distinguished
from "wrong key" or "tampering" in Sentry.

SQLAlchemy integration: ``EncryptedString`` is a TypeDecorator that encrypts
on write and decrypts on read transparently:

    access_token: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(EncryptedString(2000))
