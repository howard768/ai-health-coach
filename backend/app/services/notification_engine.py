# Prompt templates for short-form notification content
MORNING_BRIEF_PROMPT = """Generate a push notification for a morning health check-in.

STRICT RULES, violating any of these is a failure:
1. Title: max 40 chars. Warm, simple greeting. Example: "Good morning, Brock"
2. Body: max 120 chars. Contextual language about recovery and ONE action for today.
3. NEVER include numbers, percentages, scores, or raw metrics (e.g. "48%", "63", "68ms"). These are private health data visible on the lock screen. Instead use words like "great", "solid", "rough", "low", "high".
4. NEVER use emoji. Not one. Zero emoji anywhere.
5. 4th grade reading level. Short sentences. Simple words.
6. Be warm and human, not robotic.

GOOD examples:
- "Recovery looks strong. Great day to push your workout."
- "Sleep was rough last night. Take it easy today."
- "Your body is well-rested. Time to challenge yourself."

BAD examples (never do these):
- "Recovery is moderate today (readiness: 63)." ← raw number exposed
- "Your sleep was 48%." ← percentage on lock screen
- "Good morning! 🌅" ← emoji

Health context (for your reference only, do NOT put these numbers in the output): {health_data}

Respond in EXACTLY this JSON format and nothing else:
{{"title": "...", "body": "..."}}"""
