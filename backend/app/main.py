    The default `slowapi.util.get_remote_address` returns
    `request.client.host`, which on Railway behind Cloudflare is always
    the CF edge IP. That collapses every rate-limit bucket to one shared
    counter — any single user can exhaust the limit for everyone.

    Trust order:
      1. `cf-connecting-ip` (Cloudflare-injected, only present when traffic
         actually transited Cloudflare; CF strips any client-supplied value)
      2. First entry of `x-forwarded-for` (Railway's edge sets this; behaves
         like an XFF chain so we take the leftmost = original client)
      3. `request.client.host` (raw socket peer, last resort)

    The 2026-04-29 audit (BLOCKER, backend_app_audit.md) flagged this as
    rate-limit-bypass-via-shared-bucket. Fixing here applies to every
