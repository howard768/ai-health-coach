"""Opus narrator for Signal Engine user-facing copy.

Generates one-sentence explanations for insights that the card view
renders verbatim (``payload.effect_description``). Ship these through
Claude Opus per the plan: it's the one line the user sees daily, must
pass the voice rules, and quality > cost. Cap is 1 narration + 2
explanations per user per day per the plan, at current Opus pricing
that's ~$0.05/user/month, trivially cheap.

Voice compliance (no em dashes, no emoji, Flesch-Kincaid grade <= 5) is
enforced post-generation. On violation we try one mechanical scrub
(strip em dashes via ``voice_compliance.scrub_em_dashes``); if that does
not clear the checks we fall back to a templated string rather than ship
non-compliant copy.

See feedback_testing_rigor.md, every narration path has a unit test
that pins the voice invariant.
